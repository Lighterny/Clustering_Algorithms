# Clustering_Algorithms
This repo contains three projects where I explore different clustering techniques for descriptive and predictive analytics. 

## (1) Clustering
Here I compare various clustering algorithms and assess their ability to group clusters within gene data in an unsupervised manner. The models explored include single-linkage, complete-linkage, average-linkage, Ward's clustering model, and HDBSCAN. 

## (2) Naive Bayes Clustering
Understanding health expenditure through unsupervised cluster analysis and a supervised Naive Bayes classifer.
Techniques explored: 
- Gower distance matrix
- Principal co-ordinate analysis (PCoA)
- t-SNE (t-stochastic neighbour embedding)
- PAM (partition around medoids)
- Supervised Naive Bayes classifier
- Ward's hierarchical clustering model

## (3) Outlier PCA 
Anomaly detection using PCA and KNN clustering
